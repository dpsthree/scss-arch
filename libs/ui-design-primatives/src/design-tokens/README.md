# Design Tokens

This folder is used to house the raw artifacts provided by the design team.
These may arrive in the form of JSON, css or sass files.

Most design tools do not produce css output that is suitable for use in an enterprise
application. However, there is still a desire to capture as much output as possible
and track that effort in source control. By placing the content here we are able to do
that without affecting the well formatted CSS that exists elsewhere in the project.
