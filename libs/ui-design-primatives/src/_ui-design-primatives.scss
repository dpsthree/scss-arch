// This file/folder contains the raw styles, variables,
// mixins, variables, custom properties, etc that should be shared and
// available across all use cases and platforms. These are the
// primatives of the brand design.

// The design system(s) will need these to build up the components
// Apps not using a design system would use these to build
// "native" css components.

// Though this project will be built using the Angular Design
// system. A native css component set will also be built
// for demonstration purposes and to identify common code between
// the two techinques to move into this directory.

@use './base';
@use './components';
@use './layouts';
@use './overrides/wijmo-customizations'

// This is missing a few elements from a standard 7-1 setup

// Abstracts - This would likely appear as the design system grows. At the current
// complexity level it is not warrented.

// Vendors - Third party libs are not checked in. Instead they are included using
// the machinary of choice. In this case, it means a simple @use directive at the
// point of use. We see this with the addition of "overrides"

// Pages - pages are not part of a generic design system. Instead, these may appear
// in the apps SCSS file structure or encoded in the component system of the implementing
// app.

// Themes - Themes was left out as the point of this particular exercise made two
// assumptions. 1. That the point of the theme was to provide a prescriptive look and feel.
// 2. If there was a need to adjust themes based properties; it can be achieved using
// custom CSS properties
