// In this project there are two layers of Wijmo
// 1. The native collection of styles
// 2. The application of those styles in Wijmo components

// This file provides overrides to the application of Wijmo
// styles as they are applied to Wijmo components.

// Rules in this file should not have any affect on the appearance
// of Wijmo outside of the context of Angular.
// Since it consumes the base overrides, consumers need
// only import this file into their root scss file.
